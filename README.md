# Dotfiles
Those are my dotfiles for Asahi linux so the arm arch for apple silicon devices.

Some thing are not working too well, due to drivers missing but generally all
configs should universally work.

## Sources I got my configs from:

- 20% made oneself
- 40% stolen (but i try to give credit)
- 40% made with chatgpt
