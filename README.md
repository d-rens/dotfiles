# nix

## general tasks
- [ ] managing both t470 and x220 
- [ ] setting up dots in home manager
- [ ] modularize

## What configs to migrate to home-manager
- [ ] (newsboat)
- [ ] gtk, natively
- [ ] lf (lfub)
  - [ ] check vimjoyer video for that
- [ ] mpd (move from configuration.nix)
- [ ] ncmpcpp
- [ ] neomutt
- [ ] scripts
- [ ] tmux
- [ ] user-dirs, natively
- [ ] xdg stuff, natively
- [ ] xournalpp
- [ ] zathura
- [x] fish
- [x] git, natively
- [x] kitty
- [x] neovim

### no idea how to do the following in a good way: 
- [ ] jabref (weird setting to make extension work)
- [ ] xmodmap (here the program is the problem)

### configs to declare
- [ ] firefox

## Alternatives to consider while switching
- [ ] st -> kitty (for image protocoll)
- [ ] gomuks -> iamb
- [ ] firefox -> librefox/tor (are those declarable?)
- [ ] neomutt -> himalaya, rust btw
- [ ] dwm -> dwl (wayland dwm)
- [ ] dwm -> sway (wayland i3)
