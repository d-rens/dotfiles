# Dotfiles
Those are my dotfiles for Arch/Asahi linux.

Some thing are not working too well, due to drivers missing but generally all
configs should universally work.

## Sources I got my configs from:

- 20% made oneself
- 40% stolen (but i try to give credit)
- 40% made with chatgpt


## Programs
OS: Arch

WM: bwpwm

Terminal: alacritty

Texteditor: nvim

viewer: zathura

rss: newsboat

Shell: zsh

audio something: pipewire
